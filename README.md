# Pricing Component Challenge - Completed

## Overview

Hi there, thank you for you checking out this project ❤️

The goal of this project was to create a visually appealing and functionally robust pricing component. To further enhance the development experience and the application's performance, I've employed a modern tech stack involving TypeScript, Next.js, React.js, and Tailwind CSS.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: Added strong typing to JavaScript, improving development and debugging.
  
- **Next.js**: Utilized for server-side rendering, improving the SEO and performance of the app.
  
- **React.js**: Employed for building the UI components in a maintainable and efficient way.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for rapid UI development without leaving the HTML.

## Features Implemented

### Toggle Control

- Users can control the toggle to switch between different pricing plans. This was implemented using React state management to ensure reactivity.

### Responsive Design

- The application is fully responsive, providing an optimized layout across various device screen sizes. Tailwind's utility-first CSS was particularly useful here.

### Interactive Elements

- All buttons, toggles, and other interactive elements have specified hover and focus states for better UX. Tailwind CSS classes were utilized to achieve this.
